# Introduction

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is an ecological observation facility that collects data on rapidly changing ecological processes in the United States. NEON has standardized data from 81 field sites that span across the United States within 20 eco-climatic domains that represent regions of distinct landforms, vegetation, climate and ecosystem dynamics. NEON measures the causes and effects of environmental change in different types of environments. The different types of field sites include core terrestrial sites, core aquatic sites, relocatable terrestrial sites, and relocatable aquatic sites. The different sites ensure that the data will statistically represent ecological, physical, and biological differences spanning the continent. 
As seen from the image below, the field sites are also in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.

This image shows where the NEON sites are located including: aquatic sites, NEON core sites, and NEON relocatable sites are located. Understanding this data is important because it can be used by scientists, researchers, professors, and students to gain knowledge about ecological differences between different environments on recent ongoing data collection. 

# Methods

Describe briefly where the data came from (information in the pdf file in the data folder) and how you are analyzing them (e.g. using R to visualize the results and an ANOVA to test for significant differences).

# Results

```{r load-in-data}
# read in the litterfall data from a csv
litterfall_data <- read.csv("data/ltr_massdata.csv",
                            header = TRUE)
```

The dataset we have contains information on...

```{r subset-out-functionalGroup-data}
# just look at site 'HARV'
Woody_data <- subset(litterfall_data,
                    functionalGroup == "Woody material")
```

```{r boxplot-of-functional-types}
# mass of litter by functional type
boxplot(dryMass ~ siteID,
        data = Woody_data,
        main = "Mass of litterfall by Woody Material",
        xlab = "Woody Material of Sites",
        ylab = "Dry mass of litter in grams")
```

**Figure 1:** This boxplot shows that...

When we visualize the differences between functional groups, we see that... These differences (are/are not) significant (ANOVA p = xxyz).

```{r statistical-test}
# test for significance between the groups
anova(lm(dryMass ~ siteID,
         data = Woody_data))
```

Add a number of code chunks in the Results section. These should read in, subset, plot (no need to save it to pdf, since it will be put into the rendered docx when you click 'knit'), and run a statistical test on your dataset.

# Discussion

Discuss the results you found. Which sites had the highest amounts of litter mass? The smallest? Why do you think this is so?
