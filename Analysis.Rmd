# Introduction

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is an ecological observation facility that collects data on rapidly changing ecological processes in the United States. NEON has standardized data from 81 field sites that span across the United States within 20 eco-climatic domains that represent regions of distinct landforms, vegetation, climate and ecosystem dynamics. NEON measures the causes and effects of environmental change in different types of environments. The different types of field sites include core terrestrial sites, core aquatic sites, relocatable terrestrial sites, and relocatable aquatic sites. The different sites ensure that the data will statistically represent ecological, physical, and biological differences spanning the continent. As seen from the image below, the field sites are also in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.

This image shows where the NEON sites are located including: aquatic sites, NEON core sites, and NEON relocatable sites are located. Understanding this data is important because it can be used by scientists, researchers, professors, and students to gain knowledge about ecological differences between different environments on recent ongoing data collection. 

# Methods

The data collected at the sites is called Litterfall. This data of litter and fine woody debris is collected from each site by field sampling techniques, and sensor-derived airborne remote methods at different scales. This includes collecting data from elevated areas, ground traps, and single collection events. Mass data was collected using different functional groups which includes, leaves, needles, twigs/branches, woody material, seeds, flowers, lichen/other, and mixed. This data is used to estimate annual Aboveground Net Primary Productivity (ANPP) and biomass at the sites. Also, it can be used to understand vegetative carbon fluxes over time. We are analyzing this data using R to create a boxplot and ANOVA test to determine if there are significant differences of functional groups at the varying sites. 

# Results

```{r load-in-data}
# read in the litterfall data from a csv
litterfall_data <- read.csv("data/ltr_massdata.csv",
                            header = TRUE)
```

The dataset we have contains information on the varying 81 sites and their litterfall dry mass of the different functional groups. 

```{r subset-out-functionalGroup-data}
# just look at all sites with 'woody material'
Woody_data <- subset(litterfall_data,
                    functionalGroup == "Woody material")
```

```{r boxplot-of-functional-types}
# mass of litter by functional type
boxplot(dryMass ~ siteID,
        data = Woody_data,
        main = "Mass of litterfall by Woody Material",
        xlab = "Woody Material of Sites",
        ylab = "Dry mass of litter in grams")
```

**Figure 1:** This boxplot shows that the difference in woody material between the 7 sites that contained woody material. 

```{r statistical-test- ANOVA}
# test for significance between the groups
anova(lm(dryMass ~ siteID,
         data = Woody_data))
```

A statistical test of an ANOVA was used to determine if there is a significant difference of woody material between the seven sites used in the boxplot. When we visualize the differences between functional groups, we see that... These differences (are/are not) significant (ANOVA p = xxyz).

# Discussion

'HARV' site contained the most amount of dry mass in grams of 

Discuss the results you found. Which sites had the highest amounts of litter mass? The smallest? Why do you think this is so?
